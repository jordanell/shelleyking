            Originally born in New Brunswick, my family quickly moved to Vancouver
            Island to root itself in this beautiful province and become a part
            of the community.
          </p>
          <p>
            Early in my life, I had a passion for real estate and was well on my
            way to becoming a realtor, however sometimes life throws you a curveball.
            When I learned I was expecting a 2nd daughter, I put my real estate dreams
            on hold to focus more on my growing family.
          </p>
          <p>
            Early in my career, I was an employee of Save on Foods for almost 30 years,
            getting to know members of the community and becoming part of it myself.
            I later moved on to Dogwood Dental as an administrative assistant where I spent
            5 great years.
          </p>
          <p>
            After having a great career, I have finally come back to my one true passion,
            real estate.

            Real estate has been a long term passion for me. Having grown up in Campbell
            River, I know the area well and look forward to sharing my knowledge with you.
            I love the island life and everything it has to offer. Let me help you find your piece
            of this paradise called Campbell River.
